# This file contains descriptions for the seqConsolidateR program and options available for configuring the analysis.
program_short_description : "R-based nucleotide sequence consolidater. Consolidate nucleotide sequences down to unique sequences and produce a key to revert back."

# The following are descriptions of options.
seqFile : "Sequence file to consolidate to unique sequences, either fasta or fastq format."
output : "Output fasta file name. Ex. sample.consolidated.fasta"
keyFile : "Key file output name. Ex. sample.r1.csv"
seqName : "Name to append to unique sequences. Ex. sample.r1."
stat : "File name for stat file output (CSV format)."
compress : "Output fasta file is gzipped."

# Some error and other output messages.
unrecognized_file_type : "Unrecognized output file type, please choose '*.fasta' or '*.fastq'."
compression_note : "Gzip compression is acceptable as well."
fastq_input : "Since consolidation of sequences is only based on sequences, quality scores will be dropped. Output file will be in fasta format."
output_keyfile_type : "Output key file type not supported. Please use csv, tsv, rds, or RData."
