# This file contains descriptions for the seqTrimR program and options available for configuring the analysis.
program_short_description : "R-based nucleotide sequence trimmer. Trim both leading and overreading ends of sequences."

# The following are descriptions of options.
seqFile : "Sequence file to trim, either fasta or fastq format."
output : "Output file name."
leadTrimSeq : "Sequence to trim from 5' end of reads, or the leading sequence. See README for sequence flexibility."
overTrimSeq : "Sequence to trim from 3' end of reads, or the overreading sequence. See README for sequence flexibility."
phasing : "Number of nucleotides to remove from 5' end of sequence before trimming. Default = 0."
maxMismatch : "Maximum allowable mismatches in leading or overreading trim sequences."
leadMismatch : "Maximum allowable mismatches in leading trim sequence. Default = 0. If multiple matching regions for leading seq, separate mismatches allowed using a space."
overMismatch : "Maximum allowable mismatches in overreading trim sequence. Default = 0."
overMaxLength : "Maximum length to consider of the overTrimSeq to use for alignments. See README for in depth explanation of this feature. Default 20 nts."
overMinLength : "Minimum length to consider of the overTrimSeq to use for alignments. See README for in depth explanation of this feature. Default 3 nts."
minSeqLength : "Minimum length of trimmed sequence. Any trimmed sequence with a length below this value will be filtered out. Default = 30"
collectRandomIDs : "Option to collect random nucleotide sequences from trimmed portions. If used, provide an output file name."
noFiltering : "Will not filter reads based on leadTrimSeq, the default behavior."
noQualTrimming : "Will not quality trim reads, the default behavior."
badQualBases : "Number of bases below threshold in sliding window before read is trimmed. Default = 5."
qualSlidingWindow : "Slinding window size for which to assess quality scores below threshold. Default = 10."
qualThreshold : "Quality threshold for trimming, minimum allowable score. Default = '?', Q30."
stat : "File name for stat file output (CSV format)."
compress : "Output fastq files are gzipped."
cores : "Max cores to be used. If 0 or 1 (default), program will not utilize parallel processing."
